1. Linear Search
  - Searching element through array by looping the array and checking each elements one by one
  - Worst case scenario ( can find only in the last index, or can't find at all) => O(n)
  - Best case scenario (found immediately in the first index) => Ω(1)
  
 2. Binary Search
  - Searching element thorough sorted array using divide and conquer method
  - Get first index and last index, get the middle index using those two, and compare with the target
  - If target is not the same with the middle one and larger than the middle one, change the start index to the middle one plus one, and repeat the process
  - If target is not the same with the middle one and smaller than the middle one, change the end index to the middle one minus one, and repeat the process
  - Worst case scenario (can find only in the last flow, or can't fin at all) => O (log n)
  - Best case scenario (found immediately in the first divide result) => Ω(1)
  
 3. Bubble Sort
  - Looping through array and comparing adjacent elements, and swap if the right one is greater than the left one, 
  - Leaving the highest number to the rightmost
  - Worst case scenario (the array is in reverse order, so we have to loop each index to each in the array) => O(n square)
  - Best case scenario (the array is in order already, so we have to loop only one time thorough the array) => Ω(n)
  
 4. Selection Sort
  - Looping through array and search for the smallest value
  - Swap the index of the smallest value with the first index of the unsorted part(first for starter), now second index is the first index of unsorted part
  - Repeat the process
  - Worst case scenario (the process has to be repeated through the elements of the array) => O(n square)
  - Best case scenario (the process has to be repeated through the elements of the array) => Ω(n square)
  
 5. Merge Sort
  - Separting array in half after half to get the leftmost smallest one index, or two indexes sub arrays, and then compare one or two indexes in each    subarray, swap if the left one is bigger than the right one,
  - Repeat the process for every sub arrays (main concept is recursion)
  - If all the sub arrays are sorted, merge them into bigger sub array, and repeat the process
  - Worst case scenario (dividing and comparing has to be done for every indexes) => O (n log n)
  - Best case scenario (all elements are sorted but it is required to make sure everything in in order) => Ω (n log n)
